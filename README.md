# Matrix Multiplication with OpenMP

## Code Explanation

This program performs the following steps:

1. **Command-Line Arguments**: It accepts two command-line arguments - `matrix_size` and `num_threads`. These arguments determine the size of the matrices and the number of threads to use for parallel execution.

2. **Memory Allocation**: Dynamic memory allocation is used to create three matrices `A`, `B`, and `C`. These matrices will hold the input matrices and the result of matrix multiplication.

3. **Initialization**: Matrices `A` and `B` are initialized with the value 2, while matrix `C` is initialized with zeros.

4. **Parallel Matrix Multiplication**: The core matrix multiplication operation is parallelized using OpenMP. The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive splits the work among multiple threads. Each thread calculates a portion of the result matrix `C`.

5. **Timing**: The program measures the elapsed time for the matrix multiplication using the `gettimeofday` function. This provides a measure of the program's performance.

6. **Memory Deallocation**: After the matrix multiplication is complete, memory is deallocated to prevent memory leaks.

## How to Compile and Run

To compile the program, open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the code. Use the following command:

```bash
gcc -o matrix_multiplication matrix_multiplication.c -fopenmp
